      <h2 className={utilStyles.headingXl}>Decide</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of my day goes into deciding between yes, no, and what to eat for
        lunch and dinner. I have been made aware that the amount of decision
        making I will have to do will only increase with time. That the next
        promotion will come with more questions than answers. That the society
        rewards the victorious with more lemons. While I firmly believe that the
        freedom to decide is a blessing, at times it becomes tedious and
        overwhelming for my little brain. Perhaps this overwhelm stems from
        wanting to take the 'right' decision.

        Most of schooling was learning the right answer to a given problem. I
        didn't get the memo that real™ life doesn't work this way. Reality has
        been fuzzy so far and has rendered the concept of a 'right' decision
        useless.

      <p>
        I have a theory: Decisions come from the decision models and decision
        models are stored in the gut. Gut gives you a decision model when
        presented with a view of reality. Think of decision model like a
        probability function. The models are segmented into two categories based
        on 'precision' and 'velocity'. Some decision models prioritise
        'precision' - accuracy of an assessment, and other prioritise 'velocity'
        – quickness of an assessment. When tasked with the responsibility of
        taking a decision, the gut takes lossy view of reality and picks a
        decision model with suitable attributes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over-indexing on decision models that favour precision over velocity in
        a fuzzy reality is a skill issue. This is my skill issue and it is
        consequence of a poor cost model. In 2005 I had resources to buy only
        one ice-cream a day. Today I can buy another ice-cream flavour if the
        first one turns out to be dud. 2025 is very unlike 2005. I can buy 100
        ice-creams a day. I have infinitely more disposable income now than I
        had back then (zero, basically). Taking a wrong decision is infinitely
        cheaper now than it was back then. Yet I have not updated the cost
        models in accordance to changes in my wealth. I often forget that the
        purpose of money is to be used. That its purpose to reduce the cost of
        failure and unlock better decision models.
      </p>

        Naming your child or picking a health insurance may warrant
        high-precision but an average decision does not. Months deciding which
        jeans to buy and weeks on which brand of protein powder to buy is a
        skill issue. Precision has diminishing returns and most decisions would
        benefit more from being fast than from being correct. Reckless iteration
        is better than cautious inaction. Better decision models unlock only
        when I take more decisions. The more I pick, the better my ability to
        pick the optimal precision-velocity decision model becomes. The sages
        know this well, knowledge only comes from empirical observation. I hope
        some day I internalise this too.
