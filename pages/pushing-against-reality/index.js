            <p>"Wake up, it is time."</p>
            <p>My ears were drifting away from the surface. But they could still register faint voices from the other side. I could feel my weight dissolving slowly in the quicksand of warmth. It had been three hours since I placed myself in the sleeping bag. Something powerful pulled me back to the surface. It was time for the summit push.</p>

            <p>"For sunrise summit we must leave the camp by 2 am." </p>
            <p>We left the camp by 3:30 am. Some parts within me had begun with the acceptance process. The sooner you accept the reality of failure the easier it would be, they told me. Other parts could picture only one thing — a summit with the sunrise.</p>
            <p>I rushed ahead of the pack without thinking much, like a madman. Toes throbbing with pain, a possibly torn hip flexor and the barely functioning rest of me found a group of people from a different camp. This group was ahead of all the other groups. They had left their camp by 2 am.</p>

                    <p>How do you claim to know it is impossible? To believe that something is impossible is to mistake "No one sees how it is possible" for "It is impossible". As the years have gone by, I've been increasingly struck by just how stupid humans are, and how most of our intelligence is just the painfully slow accumulation of the cultural store of better concepts. Once you keep in mind how humans have been wrong forever about most things, the fact that everyone claims that something is impossible loses its misperceived predictive force.</p>

            <p>It made no rational sense to put myself through this pain. I kept climbing up for three hours. At 6:20 am it dawned upon me that there is nothing left for me to climb. It took a while for my body to realise this, so I ambled around in awe of the human capability, with a shattered concept of reality. The domain of possibilities had expanded faster than I could make any sense of it.</p>
            <p>I was not supposed to see the sunrise on the summit but I did.</p>

                    <p>I started to understand what was happening—and what "Persevere!" really meant. ... And I realized that the word "impossible" had two usages:</p>
                    <p>1) Mathematical proof of impossibility conditional on specified axioms;</p>
                    <p>2) "I can't see any way to do that."</p>
                    <p>Needless to say, all my own uses of the word "impossible" had been of the second type.</p>

            <p>"Do or do not, there is no try" — what does it <em>really</em> mean? Why would Yoda say that? Why would I not try? That is all I <em>can</em> do.  What is it that Neo heard in "Come on! Stop trying to hit me, and hit me!" that I cannot?</p>
            <p>I can see one thing very clearly about the night of summit push now, as I piece together my life's inflection points. I was willing to be immodest — either I pass out in the way or I make it to the top of the mountain before sunrise. Trying would permit me to get away with "I did my <em>job</em>, I made an <em>attempt</em>, I did what I <em>could</em> do". But I was doing this for myself. Trying is not sufficient. The only way I can have any shot at winning is if I push hard against reality.  I don't have to be modest about how much I want something.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div className="body">
                    <p>To me, trying feels like pushing hard against my own resistance. Doing feels like pushing hard <em>against reality.</em></p>
                    <p>... When you're in doing mode instead of trying mode, the inner conflicts fall away and you can practice punching reality with your whole soul. Imagine how far you'll go if every move you make carries the entire weight of your being.</p>

            <p>It would be foolish to publicly announce that you will break a concrete wall with a punch — knowing very well that you <em>almost certainly</em> cannot. Pushing against reality can feel like punching a concrete wall.</p>
            <p>I attribute much of modesty as a response to the pain of failure. Modesty feels like a defence mechanism. Being modest about your intentions shelters you from the weight of expectations. There is no obligation to give it your all with "I might try this". "I will do this" can almost feel like a slur.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div className="body">
                    <p>1. You will be punished for trying new things.</p>

                    <p>3. You will be punished for trying to understand how good you are at something.</p>
                    <p>4. You will be punished for succeeding.</p>

            <p>In the hands of a self proclaimed rationalist, modesty becomes a weapon of self destruction. Rationalisations can be created as and when needed. They can conceal the laziness, and disguise it as modesty. All <em>tries</em> can be justified with a bit of cleverness.</p>
            <p>Modesty doesn't help. It may seem like it is helping, but it doesn't. Inaction may seem like the best survival strategy but it is not. My experience tells me that modesty has aged into futility. I think we need more immodesty.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div className="body">
                    <p>… So before I left, I told all my friends that when I come back, that book was going to be done! Yes, I would have it done - I’d have been ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about something so I’d have to perform. I found out many times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say, “Oh yes, I’ll get the answer for you Tuesday,” not having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I’m surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how to convert a situation from one view to another which would increase the chance of success.</p>

            <p>Doing the impossible is not for everyone. But it is worth your honest effort. There are enough people playing it safe, content with their concept of possibility, with frozen boundaries of reality.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <div className="body">
                    <p>We recently reported on a game played at the closing dinner at last December’s Chess Classic. During this dinner at Simpsons in the Strand they stage a now traditional simul by the players of the Classic against the guests. Most tables have one or more strong chess players whose job is to guide rather than direct. One particularly high-powered table had Rachel Reeves, MP, the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who was a UK U14 girls champion, Professor Vinayak Dravid, a leading nanotechnologist from the University of Chicago, the Indian High Commissioner Rajesh N Prasad, Jo Johnson MP, brother of Boris, and Frederic Friedel. Their advisor was Garry Kasparov … After the game some of the simul masters said Kasparov had perhaps been too generous with his advice during the game. But he vigorously denied this: “Before the critical sacrifice I said one word: ‘wow!’ Fred immediately jumped up and started to analyse with Rachel, and they worked out the sacrifice together, in less then a minute.” He then proceeded to recount the story about his 1996 game against Anand in Las Palmas, given above, and how at the time it had become clear to him that a single bit of information, passed on to a player at the right moment, could have a decisive influence on the course of a game. “If Fred was allowed to come in and signal ‘now!’ in the critical position I would have worked out 20.g4 and played it!” That’s right, it often needs just one bit of information – ‘now!’ – to change the result of a game.</p>

            <p>I would have given up if I had not found that group of climbers rushing ahead of everyone else. It felt that they were climbing a completely different mountain. That is all it took — a hint of a different possibility. The courage to be immodest was passed to me by the people marching ahead. They showed me that something real exists beyond my concept of reality.</p>

            <p>I often think of ways to reduce the cost of risk, of making failure cheaper, and making courage more accessible. It is only fair that I pass along what the climbers ahead left for me. It is a thing of pure joy to see others climb the mountains that they earlier thought they couldn't.</p>

                    <p>Meeting magicians is the first step to becoming one – when you are attempting to learn implicit knowledge that by definition you don’t understand, it is important to have a bunch of examples in front of you to feed your brain’s pattern-recognition systems. This will start to change your worldview without the controlling 'you' explicitly approving or denying every new belief or framework.</p>
