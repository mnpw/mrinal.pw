                I came across Mr. <Link

                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Wastl</Link> and his shenanigans during a cold winter in an ancient time. His handmade programming puzzles caught my attention. He called the challenge Advent of Code. The project seemed like the cool cousin of Project Euler to me. For the uninitiated, Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar where a new programming puzzle unlocks everyday from December 1 to December 25 every year.

                My interest in gophers peaked around the same time (perhaps it was <Link href="https://github.com/mnpw/AoC-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</Link>?). Naturally, as one must do, I learned enough <Link href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Go</Link> to make a decent attempt at the <Link href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</Link> puzzles that winter. I had a fun time, but Go and I slowly drifted apart after our first date at the AoC arcade. Two years later it was time for me to go on another date â€” with a crab.
            </p>
            <p>
                With fewer hair on my head and more free time on my hand, I decided to make a serious attempt at the 2021 edition of AoC. My goal this time was to focus on clarity and readability instead of cleverness. I saw the appeal of the way each puzzle was structured with AoC. Having two parts in each problem forces you to think of simplicity and extensibility of your solutions. This would be a great way to learn the language of the crabs, I thought. It was time to write the solutions in <Link href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rust</Link>.

                I maintained a diary of sorts as I went about collecting stars for every puzzle I solved this time. The world has space for one more person wanting to talk about their sorrows and joys of coding. Grab some popcorn. I'm open sourcing the dearest diary for your reading pleasure now.

                    Dear diary, I did not know I still had it in me. It has been so long since I wrote code, I thought I lost the sacred knowledge. What was more surprising was that I had not forgotten how to employ the power of dynamic programming. I felt so cool after getting the stars today.

                    I feel sad. I had a fight with the borrow checker. Perhaps she got angry in response to my desire for abstraction? I wanted to code a general puzzle solver. I wanted to make a scalable solution. Big mistake. Leaving this puzzle in between to go on a vacation helped me realize my mistake. Done is better than perfect. I finally did it but I'm not happy with the code structure.

                    Making my code 'generic' bit my ass again. How many times before I learn? Going out for a run and spending time away from the computer helped in solving this puzzle. It turns out that writing a customizable core depth-first-search function is not as easy as I thought it was going to be. The bug in my code was the assumption that the first encountered smallcase node must be the repeatable node. Biases into play. We must let any smallcase node be repeatable, not just the first one.

I knocked at the official advent of code subreddit door for a hint and my eye went to a very short solution. Makes me feel I'm writing dumb code. Maybe dumb but readable solutions are better than concise and cryptic solutions. Too much effort in fixing upside down printing. I will just turn my laptop upside down for the answer.

                The reason why I initially picked Rust was not because it was fast or reliable or productive. I picked it because cool people were using it and they said that it has a steep learning curve. I wanted to push myself. I wanted to learn about the philosophy behind the design of a language that was very much evolving. In the process of becoming familiar with Rust â€” the programming language, I also became familiar with Rust â€” the historical artefact.
