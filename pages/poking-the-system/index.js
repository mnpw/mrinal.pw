            <p>Reading has a lifespan.  Reading ingredients on a packaging is not the same as reading a thousand page novel.  One is <em>bigger</em> than the other.  There is a notion of physicality associated with all kinds of things — including time.  What takes less time feels small.  What takes more time seems big.  A decade feels physically bigger than a second to me.</p>
            <p>Like reading, all activities work on timescales — in the form of tasks or in the form of a project.  Tasks live for a short time; they tend to be simpler and easier.  Projects live longer; they are built of ambition and novelty.  Tasks are small and projects are big.</p>
            <p><em>Smallness</em> is easy to understand.  My brain is much more efficient at processing small chunks of time.  I know in my gut what it feels like to pay attention for seconds, minutes or hours; how four is different from fourteen.  I can feel the size of a room.  I cannot say the same about a continent.  <em>Bigness</em> is fuzzy.  Things become hard to distinguish beyond a certain size.  Paying attention for a month feels no different than paying attention for a year or a decade.  A billion isn't that different from a trillion, is it?  They seem different but feel the same.</p>
            <p>Polarity strengthens with time and the perception scale of physicality keeps on shifting.  Small things become smaller and big things become bigger.  Minutes become the new hour and months blend into decades.  Simple becomes boring and challenging becomes scary.  We lose the details and the bigness becomes fuzzier.  I blame the rampant expansion of our universe.  Things are moving at an incomprehensible pace.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>It is easier to watch a thirty second video than to sit for hours with a documentary; easier to write fifty words than to write fifty thousand words; and easier to draw for an hour than to fill a canvas with months.  Fleeting things ask for little effort and attention.  But the mirror can only reflect as much as it takes.  Fleeting things can only respond with fleeting joy.</p>
            <p>I wish to work on meaningful endeavors that span multiple years.  The pursuit of a project is a worthy goal in itself.  Projects carry prestige, tasks do not.  The challenge of a project is enticing.  A challenge evokes the sense of flow.  It reveals the richness of my hidden parts.  The arduous challenge of a project is bigger than tasks.  It is also harder to realize.  A project can feel too distant, devoid of any details, and boring.  It can also feel immeasurable, overwhelming, and scary.  The obscurity surrounding meaningful endeavors — that projects are — pushes people away towards the simplicity of tasks.</p>
            <p>The parallel between activities and their perceived physicality can be very useful in reasoning better about projects.  Small pieces hide in the fuzziness of big pieces.  Tasks and projects have a relation to them.</p>
            <p>~</p>

            <h3 className={utilStyles.headingLg}>II.</h3>
            <p>Reality has a surprising amount of detail.  Details like to hide as relations and hidden relations shine bright when you illuminate in a certain way.</p>
            <p>The relation between tasks and projects is not very hard to see.  Tasks integrate to a project and a project disintegrates to tasks.  This knowledge, however simple, is non-trivial.  In a colloquial sense of the words 'science' and 'art', disintegration is like a science and integration is like an art.  Moving from the abstract to concrete in one and moving from the concrete to abstract in another.  Analyzing in one and synthesizing in another.</p>
            <p>The ability to analyze a problem well is widely recognized, highly desired, and handsomely rewarded.  It is natural that we value breaking big and complex things down to small and simple things.  Atoms don't have problems, humans do.  Problems exist only in higher dimensions.  They only grow in the fertility of sufficient complexity.  With the hammer of first principles we can break big monsters into hundred tiny monsters.  This very simple idea sparked the industrial revolution.  This idea is the default way to make problems go away today.  First principles thinking is the darling of all corporations.</p>
            <p>This top-down relation is how we relate projects and tasks best.  A project can be broken down into simpler tasks.  But death is the precursor to decomposition; you must kill in order to analyze.</p>
            <p>A cluster of cells becomes life at some point.  Synthesis gives rise to emergent properties.  With sufficient order, life emerges from nothingness.  Atoms turn into people, people turn into families, families turn into communities, communities turn into towns, towns turn into cities, cities turn into countries.  Tasks can integrate into projects.  The bottom-up relation between tasks and projects is harder to see with foresight.</p>
            <p>Emergence is not deterministic enough.  It is a mysterious process — akin to magic.  It is tough to tame.  Betting on emergence makes for a bad business principle — What if the parts integrate poorly to be less than the sum?  Things with little utilitarian value wither away from common knowledge.</p>
            <p>~</p>
            <p>Over-reliance analysis makes things dull.  The top-down view is too predictable and feels stagnant.  Leaning too heavy on synthesis can be chaotic.  The bottom-up view is too unpredictable and impractical.  What is lacking in one is the strength of the other.  Analysis and synthesis are two sides of the same coin.  They do not exist in isolation.  They co-exist and they co-evolve.  Analysis demystifies synthesis and synthesis strengthens analysis.</p>
            <p>I like to believe that there is a rhythm of cyclicality to most things.  Tasks, projects, analysis and synthesis form an ecosystem that is in constant motion.  Cultivating an understanding of the interplay of these parts is a critical part for making the concept of a project comprehensible.  A project requires a fine iterative balance.  To balance well is to <em>design</em> well.</p>
