      <p>Hi, I'm Mrinal Paliwal üëãüèº</p>
      <p>
        I work as Systems Engineer 2 at Bytebeam. I've spent the last two years
        here taking care of our data pipeline. I also own our data broker
        service!

        is a deep-tech IoT startup building AWS for IoT devices. We build the
        control plane through which companies can provision, update, debug, and
        gather data from hardware devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work closely with the CEO, CTO, and our enterprise customers on the
        data pipeline at Bytebeam. Our data pipeline has four main components:
        Device SDKs, an in-house MQTT data broker written in Rust ü¶Ä, storage
        layer, and analytics services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I worked on re-architecting the broker and storage layer of
        our pipeline. Our broker had a write bottleneck to Clickhouse and our
        analytics services had a read bottleneck on Clickhouse. I worked on
        optimising writes from Broker and migrating storage layer from
        Clickhouse to Object Store (S3 and equivalent). It solved for the
        bottlenecks and also enabled data-lake-like persistence to pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data broker service, which I maintain, acts as gateway between IoT
        devices and internal services. We've built it in-house using Rust and
        have also open-sourced it. I have worked on a bunch of features for it
        and maintain its release lifecycle for our cloud and enterprise
        customers (for whom we have a Bring Your Own Cloud model).

        runtimes, streaming systems, and databases.
