            Hey Jake ðŸ‘‹
        </p>
        <p>
            I stumbled upon Railway a long time ago on Twitter. Thank goodness I did. The level of <a
                href="https://blog.railway.app/p/how-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">care</a> and <a
                href="https://feedback.railway.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transparency</a> you folks operate
            with makes me very happy.
            Opening and closing the (<a href="https://www.notion.so/Open-Jobs-bdc641c4b72947f2ab1e09bea5362363"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">now
                retired?</a>) jobs page too many times has led to this mail. I want to explore how my engineering
            toolbox fits on this train.

            I'm Mrinal. I am a creative technologist. I've been programming professionally for ~2 years. Programming,
            for me, is a way to articulate nuance <em>for</em> people <em>through</em> computers. I care about
            communicating nuance, that is why I code.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've spent the majority of the last two years engineering solutions in the <a
                href="https://www.makemytrip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> travel industry</a>. My work focused
            on empowering customers by
            enhancing support
            platforms, working on third-party <a href="https://6eholidays.makemytrip.com/holidays-india/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener"> collaborations</a>, and
            driving documentation culture within engineering teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            More recently, I decided to take a break from work to focus on <a href="https://mrinal.pw/notes"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                writing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mnpw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                building</a>. I like to type things - code, essays and silly little thoughts.
            I have written about my <a href="https://mrinal.pw/engineering-process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                engineering process</a> â€” how it has evolved over years â€” in depth. Oh, and I <strike>like</strike>
            <em>love</em> to
            talk meta about <a href="https://mrinal.pw/poking-the-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                systems</a> and pushing <a href="https://mrinal.pw/pushing-against-reality" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">reality</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important for me to work on ideas that encourage creative risk and reduce the cost of failure â€” ideas
            that provide the foundational blocks that others can use to do amazing things. I care about making things
            for people who make things.
        </p>
        <p>
            I use a lot of high quality duct-tape, care and courage in my engineering process to do whatever it takes to
            build 'tools with emotion'. I want to build beautiful things with great people. This is where <em>you</em>
            come in.
            The tracks (hahaha geddit?) have led me here. Let's chat?
